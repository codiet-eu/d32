# Datasets for Causal Structure Learning

## Synthetic datasets
We provide codes for generating synthetic datasets used in '[Causal Discovery with Reinforement Learning](../research/Causal%20Discovery%20with%20RL)'. Please see the [example notebook](examples_to_generate_synthetic_datasets.ipynb) for further details.

## Real datasets
### Telecom causal dataset
### PCIC competition datasets

The real datasets (id:10, 21, 22) used in [PCIC Causal Discovery Competition 2021 ](https://competition.huaweicloud.com/information/1000041487/introduction) have been made available online: [link](https://github.com/gcastle-hub/dataset).

The following table contains F1-scores of some competitive causal discovery algorithms on these datasets.
