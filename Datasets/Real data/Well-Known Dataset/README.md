### Telecom causal dataset
We release a very challenging [dataset](https://github.com/zhushy/causal-datasets/tree/master/Real_Dataset) from real telecommunication networks, to find causal structures based on time series data. 

### Data format
- **real_dataset_processed.csv**: each row counts the numbers of occurrences of the alarms (A_i,i=0,1,...,56) in 10 minutes. The rows are arranged in the time order, i.e., first 10 mins., second 10 mins., etc.
- **true_graph.csv**: the underlying causal relationships, according to expert experience.  `(i,j)=1` implies an edge `i->j`.
